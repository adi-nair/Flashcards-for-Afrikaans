# Flashcards-for-Afrikaans
A python flash card application made using tkinter and pandas to learn the top 300 words used in Afrikaans for an English speaker. 

The flashcards display words in Afrikaans and when the user knows a word they must press the tick button else the cross button. 

The application keeps track of the words the user was not able to recall and stores the data in a .csv file. 

When the application is run later only the words which the user was not able to recall in the previous run will be displayed.
